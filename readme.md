## About The Project


Welcome to our PHP framework! Our framework focuses on simplicity and ease of use, allowing you to build powerful applications without the need for extensive documentation or a steep learning curve. With its MVC architecture and intuitive features, you'll be up and running in no time!

Key Features:

- **Easy to Understand:** Our framework is designed with simplicity in mind. You can grasp the entire framework and its concepts within just a few hours, making it ideal for developers of all skill levels.
- **MVC Architecture:** The framework follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, providing a structured approach to organizing your code and separating business logic from presentation.
- **Rendering Engine with Layout Support:** Our framework includes a rendering engine that supports layouts, allowing you to easily create consistent and reusable templates for your application's views.
- **Code Execution within Views:** You can execute code directly within your views, making it convenient to dynamically generate content to each view.
- **Email Management:** We provide simple-to-use managers for sending emails, leveraging the power of PHPMailer and other libraries. Sending emails from your application becomes a breeze.
- **Database Communication:** Our framework simplifies database communication, providing libraries that streamline database queries and operations. Interacting with your database has never been easier.
- **Dependency Management with Composer:** We utilize Composer, a popular dependency management tool for PHP, to keep your project up-to-date with the latest dependencies and libraries.
